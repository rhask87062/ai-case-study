# Extropic: Thermodynamic Computing for AI Acceleration

## Overview and Origin

# Name: Extropic

Incorporation Details: Extropic was founded in 2022 and is headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Founders: Extropic was founded by Guillaume Verdon (CEO) and Trevor McCourt (CTO), former researchers from Alphabet's quantum computing team.

Idea Genesis: The idea for Extropic's novel chip architecture stemmed from the realization that traditional digital computing is approaching fundamental limits, hindering the advancement of AI. Inspired by the efficiency of biological systems, Verdon and McCourt sought to develop a new computational paradigm that leverages the intrinsic randomness and discrete interactions found in nature.

Funding: In December 2023, Extropic announced that it had raised $14.1 million in seed funding led by Kindred Ventures, with participation from Buckley Ventures, HOF Capital, Julian Capital, Marque VC, OSS Capital, Valor Equity Partners, and Weekend Fund.

  

## Business Activities

Problem Solving: Extropic's chip architecture addresses the limitations of digital computing in handling the insatiable demand for computing power driven by the rapid advancement of AI. Extropic utilizes a chip that excels at the type of probabilistic computation required by generative AI.

Target Customer: High-value customers like governments, banks, and private clouds that require powerful and energy-efficient AI acceleration for generative AI tasks.

Unique Solution: Extropic's thermodynamic chip architecture is much more efficient at probabilistic computations required by AI than a traditional digital microchip. 

Technology Utilization: At the core of Extropic's technology are superconducting chips that operate at low temperatures and exploit the Josephson effect to access non-Gaussian probability distributions crucial for modeling real-world applications.

The company is also developing semiconductor devices that can operate at room temperature, sacrificing some energy efficiency but enabling broader market reach using standard manufacturing processes.

  

## Landscape

Field: AI chip technology

Trends and Innovations: Recent trends in AI hardware development include the rise of specialized AI accelerators like GPUs, TPUs, and FPGAs, as well as the exploration of novel computing paradigms like quantum computing and neuromorphic computing to overcome the limitations of traditional digital processors.

Major Competitors: Major competitors in the AI chip market include established players like NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and other startups who are also developing AI specific hardware.


## Results

Business Impact: Extropic's new chip architecture is still in the early stages, but the company has already garnered significant attention and funding from investors, positioning itself as a potential disruptor in the AI hardware market.

Success Metrics: Extropic's success will likely be measured by the performance and energy efficiency of its chips compared to existing AI accelerators, as well as their ability to unlock new capabilities in generative AI and probabilistic modeling.

Market Position: While Extropic is a newcomer in the AI chip market, its innovative approach and the expertise of its founding team have positioned the company as a promising contender in the race to develop the next generation of AI hardware.


## Recommendations
Future Products: Extropic could utilize their more cost effective semiconductor that operates at room temperatures to make consumer based AI hardware.
Benefits of Suggestions: Broadening the applicability of Extropic's technology could open up new market opportunities and position the company as a leading provider of energy-efficient AI acceleration solutions across various domains.
Technology Requirements: To realize these suggestions, Extropic may need to further refine its chip design and software stack to support a wider range of AI algorithms and workloads, as well as develop efficient scaling and parallelization techniques for its stochastic analog circuits.
